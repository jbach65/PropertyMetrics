# PropertyMetrics

## Zillow Scraping
The first problem I set out to solve was programatically scraping info from zillow listings. 
For this I started by using requests and beautiful soup to scrape certain metrics for each url that I am interesed in.
I initially ran into a 403 error, but once I formatted the request to mimic a browser, I was able to get the listing homepage.
